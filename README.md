# Simple-Calculator
A very simple calculator made from HTML, CSS, and JS.

# Instructions
Once the index is opened into a browser, just click whatever numbers you want, then an operator, then some more numbers. The calculator supports multiple operator usage. Basically you can evaluate 10+5-10. 
This calculator is extremely simple and doesn't have parenthesis buttons.
Also, if this is a thing you want to copy and use in your website, BEWARE it uses eval(). This is a thing I'm trying to change, and once I do, I will update this.

# Keyboard Controls
It's pretty straightforward. Here's a list of key commands:
- "1" : 1
- "2" : 2
- "3" : 3
- "4" : 4
- "5" : 5
- "6" : 6
- "7" : 7
- "8" : 8
- "9" : 9
- "0" : 0
- "." : .
- "+" : Shift + +
- "-" : -
- "*" : Shift + 8
- "/" : /
- "Back" : Backspace
- "Clear" : Delete
- "Equal" : Enter

# Inspiration
Got the idea to code this from Idea Bag 2. Just precticing things I already knew and trying to learn some new working knowledge along the way.
