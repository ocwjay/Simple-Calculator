# Simple-Calculator
A very simple calculator made from HTML, CSS, and JS.

# Instructions
Once the index is opened into a browser, just click whatever numbers you want, then an operator, then some more numbers. The calculator supports multiple operator usage. Basically you can evaluate 10+5-10. 
This calculator is extremely simple and doesn't have parenthesis buttons.
Also, if this is a thing you want to copy and use in your website, BEWARE it uses eval(). This is a thing I'm trying to change, and once I do, I will update this.

# Keyboard Controls
It's pretty straightforward. Here's a list of key commands:
- 1 : 1
- 2 : 2
- 3 : 3
- 4 : 4
- 5 : 5
- 6 : 6
- 7 : 7
- 8 : 8
- 9 : 9
- 0 : 0
- . : .
- + : Shift + +
- - : -
- * : Shift + 8
- / : /
- Back : Backspace
- Clear : Delete
- Equal : Enter

# Inspiration
Got the idea to code this from Idea Bag 2. Just precticing things I already knew and trying to learn some new working knowledge along the way.
