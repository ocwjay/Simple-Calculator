# Simple-Calculator
A very simple calculator made from HTML, CSS, and JS.

# Instructions
Once the index is opened into a browser, just click whatever numbers you want, then an operator, then some more numbers. The calculator supports multiple operator usage. Basically you can evaluate 10+5-10. 
This calculator is extremely simple and doesn't have parenthesis buttons.
Also, if this is a thing you want to copy and use in your website, BEWARE it uses eval(). This is a thing I'm trying to change, and once I do, I will update this.

# Inspiration
Got the idea to code this from Idea Bag 2. Just precticing things I already knew and trying to learn some new working knowledge along the way.
